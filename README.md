# jpa-react-security-jwt
Study Jpa, Jwt, Spring Security and React.js

I tried to make Spring application with using cross browsing.
 1. make backend with spring boot.
 2. make frontend with npx create-react-app.
 3. then, both app uses different port.
 4. use cors setting to make it one.

By creating this app, I could understand how to make Spring Boot Application, Using React.js.
Wihtout cross browsing, but also using JWT with spring security.
